# Photo Gallery Images

Add your engagement photos or couple photos here to display in the gallery.

## Required Files

Place 6 photos in this folder with the following names:

- `photo1.jpg`
- `photo2.jpg`
- `photo3.jpg`
- `photo4.jpg`
- `photo5.jpg`
- `photo6.jpg`

## Recommendations

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best, but any ratio will work
- **Size**: Optimize images to ~1000px width for faster loading
- **Quality**: Use high-quality images, but compress them for web

## Tips

- You can use more or fewer photos by editing `index.html`
- To add more photos, duplicate a `.gallery-item` div and update the image source
- To remove photos, delete the corresponding `.gallery-item` div

## Tools for Image Optimization

- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) - Free online image compression
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - Google's image compression tool
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) - Mac app for image optimization

## Example

If you have photos named differently, either:
1. Rename them to match `photo1.jpg` through `photo6.jpg`, or
2. Update the image sources in `index.html` to match your filenames
